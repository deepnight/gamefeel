# About

This prototype is not exactly an actual game but a tool to learn game-feel techniques.

![g01-compare](https://github.com/deepnight/gamefeel/assets/1671695/1df44af1-d244-46d6-a2d0-59568b1eff4c)


**It was designed to show the impact of small details on the overall quality and feeling of a game.**

You can enable or disable individual game features in this demo by pressing the START button (gamepad) or the ENTER key (keyboard).

# Compiling

The individual examples should be quite self-explanatory and rather straight forward to implement in any game engine. However, if you need any kind of insight on how they work, feel free to open an issue or drop my an email :)

You will need the [Haxe](https://haxe.org) compiler and [Heaps](https://heaps.io)  library.

You should read the instructions on my GameBase project (https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase).
